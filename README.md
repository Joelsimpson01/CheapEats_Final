To run our program you will need a python interpriter. (We used 3.9)

You will also need to create your own virtual enviroment and setup your python inturpriter.

Follow these steps -

*Delete venv file from the downloaded code.
*This should prompt you to setup the interpriter add add a 3.9 python inturpreter.
*Otherwise goto file > settings > python interpretor and add a 3.9 python inturpreter from there.
*Next you will have to download the flask package if you havent already.
*Simply right click on flask at the top off app.py.
*Select show content actions then select install flask package.
*Now you should be ok to run the program.
*Goto terminal at the bottom left of the screen and enter in python app.py
*It will creat the server and link a domain for you to use.





*Troubleshooting*

We had some issues with scripts coming from unknown locations
To fix this you need to go to PowerShell on your desktop and run it as an admin.
From there check your execution policy by entering get-executionpolicy.
If your execution policy is restriced we want to change that by writing set-executionpolicy Unrestricted.
Follow the steps on screen to complete that process.
